# LigandXplore: A Computational Pipeline for Early-Stage Drug Discovery



LigandXplore is a Python-based cheminformatics pipeline that leverages a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize the properties of drug-like molecules, specifically focusing on ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, Toxicity) properties.  This project empowers researchers to efficiently explore and refine potential drug candidates by automatically evolving molecular structures towards improved characteristics.  Users input a starting SMILES string for their ligand and select a target ADMET property from a provided list to optimize.  The GA then explores the chemical space around the initial ligand, applying various mutation operators, evaluating the fitness of each mutated molecule based on the chosen ADMET property prediction, and iteratively evolving a population of ligands. The results of the mutation process, including the operator used, the mutated SMILES, and the predicted property value, are stored in a CSV file for further analysis.

## Motivation ü§î

Drug discovery and development is a complex and resource-intensive process.  Optimizing lead compounds for desired ADMET properties is a crucial, yet often time-consuming, step. LigandXplore aims to accelerate this process by providing a tool that automates the exploration and optimization of molecular structures.  By using a genetic algorithm, LigandXplore can efficiently search a vast chemical space, identify promising candidates, and reduce the reliance on manual, trial-and-error approaches.  This project was developed to provide researchers with a readily accessible and customizable pipeline for lead optimization.

## Results üìú

This section presents examples of the outputs generated by LigandXplore, showcasing its ability to predict ADMET properties, track mutation results, and visualize optimized molecules.  These examples illustrate the pipeline's functionality and the type of information it provides to researchers.

### ADMET Prediction Graph generated for the Optimized Molecule

![ADMET Prediction Graph](Results/admet_predictions.png)

This graph displays the predicted ADMET properties the optimized molecule. It assesses the drug-likeness probability based on percentile scores of DrugBank-approved molecules. The specific ADMET properties shown on the graph (e.g., Lipophilicity, logD, etc.) are determined by the `admet_ai` library and can be customized by the user through the `admet_properties.txt` file.  This visualization helps to assess the Overall drug-likeness probability of the ligand. As shown in the graph Overall drug-likeness probability (average) of the optimized molecule is 64.94%. 

Along with that the ADMET propert of all the mutated molecules is listed in the table [View Mutation Results CSV](Results/generated_molecules_admet.csv)


### Mutation Results

This table illustrates a typical output during the mutation phase of the genetic algorithm. It shows a selection of the mutations performed, including the specific mutation operator applied (e.g., Atom Deletion, Bond Order Modification), the SMILES string of the resulting mutated molecule, and the predicted value of the target ADMET property for that molecule.  This table offers insight into how the GA explores the chemical space, highlighting the types of structural changes that influence the target property.  The full mutation data, including all mutations and their corresponding properties, is stored in the `generated_molecules_admet.csv` file within the `results` directory.
